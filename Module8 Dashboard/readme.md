# DASHBOARD HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

## Sample analysis and dashboard creation for a hypothetical real estate company

The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in properties in Toronto.

### Rental Analysis
This purpose of this notebook is to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in advance.   Once the code is running properly, it can be fed into Dashboard code and used with Panel to create the final layout. 
[Code:](rental_analysis_Final.ipynb).


### Dashboard
Utilizing the code from Rental Analysis, this notebook builds a dashboard.   The user only has to click on a particular tab to see the results.  In this particular case, the dashboard has four tabs:
1.	Displays some introductory comments.
2.	Some sample charts on property values.
3.	A chart with rental and ownership costs.
4.	A geo-spatial chart showing values by neighbourhood and physical location.
[Code:](dashboard_Final.ipynb).

### Libraries

* Panel is utilized to construct the dashboard.
