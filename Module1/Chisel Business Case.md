# **CHISEL AI, CASE STUDY**

## **OVERVIEW**
Chisel AI is an insurtech company that focuses on automating the underwriting process for commercial lines insurers or insurance brokers.  The company, headquartered in Toronto, was founded by Ron Gluzman in 2016.   The seed of the idea was founded during Ron’s student years at the University of Waterloo.   Ron disliked studying from textbooks, believing them to contain too much unnecessary information.   He created an app that extracted and summarized (400 times faster than human reading) the chapters of various textbooks.   The output was approximately 1% of the source information.   The app helped Ron excel at his courses (Ron’s intelligence also played a part), despite not regularly attending classes.   
Eventually word spread about his new app.  Ron started to sell hip app online to students at other universities and even in other countries.   While this brought some financial success for Ron, the business opportunity was limited by the customers themselves.   Most students are cash-strapped and/or unwilling to pay for the app.       
An insurance executive reached out to Ron about his app as she realized the potential to help her company and the industry save money.   Luckily for Ron, the global (P&C or Property and Casualty) insurance industry is large and has ample access to funds.  From this initial assignment, Ron founded Chisel AI, which was built specifically for insurers.
The company is funded with equity from private equity investors and angel investors.  The total dollars raised is not disclosed but there have been five rounds of capital raising and includes eleven investors.

## **BUSINESS ACTIVITIES**
Chisel’s platform can be used for policy checking, quote comparison, submission triage and submission prioritization.  Policy checking and quote comparison are self explanatory.  Submission triage refers to the time it takes from a broker’s request for a price quote to submitting a response.  Submission prioritization are the prioritization of the requests. These four purposes all stem from the underwriting process.
The insurance industry is somewhat unique in that only a subset of clients actually utilizes the service (i.e. make a claim).  The claim or the product usage can also lag the purchase by many months or even years.  For the subset of clients that make claims, they will likely be in a state of heightened anxiety, as some adverse event has affected their business.   The broker can’t go back in time to ensure the client had the appropriate coverage.   
Accordingly, at all client touchpoints before a claim (if any) is made, the broker’s job is to accurately interpret the client’s needs balanced against the cost to insure a particular risk.   The cost is provider by the insurer.   For the insurer, there are many risks and possible scenarios that they must consider.   The pricing/underwriting process follows an extensive decision tree logic which in the past was very paper intensive, mistake prone, and time-consuming.
Most clients don’t want to be burdened with paperwork.   They want a digital process.
Documentation errors are actually a very large issue for the insurance industry - re-work ratio is very high.   Mistakes are expensive financially, and they cause stress for the distribution partners (brokers or internal salespeople).    
The response time is key success factor to winning business.   It is also very important to winning new business.   One study suggests that in the insurance industry, the first responder wins the business 56% of the time.
Chisel’s platform addresses these issues.   The platform relieves the distribution partners of much of their administrative burden, speeds up the underwriting process and cuts the error rate.  The system can interpret any insurance document 400X faster than a human.  What used to take days can now be done in minutes.  That means the distribution partners have more time to generate more revenue and/or work on higher value-added client activities.  A reduction in errors means 1) a happier customer and a leg up on the competition, 2) up to 80% cost reduction, and 3) prevent unnecessary assumption of liability (Errors and Omissions = E&O).   
Chisel’s tool can also be used for policy checking, quote comparison, submission triage and submission prioritization.
In layman’s terms, Chisel’s platform reads through unstructured data and harnesses this data to automate and standardize the process.  It extracts, reads, interprets and understands 500 data elements used in the insurance industry.  The platform also interacts with the insurer’s CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and any ratings engine that may be used.  
To accomplish this, its prime technology is Natural Language Processors (NLP).   In this case, NLP is superior to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) because NLP uses machine learning to improve and does not remain static.  Chisel also utilized Named Entity Recognition (NER) to recognize 500 data elements specific to insurance.   
Other specific technologies include HTML5, Google Analytics, and JQuery.

## **LANDSCAPE**
Chisel’s platform is built specifically for commercial insurance carriers and brokers.  Accordingly, Chisel is a unique niche player in the Insurtech Space.   It would not be surprising if large insurance companies or large brokers are working internally to compete with Chisel.
Outside the administrative services that Chisel provides, there have been many insurance quote marketplaces, and underwriting services using drones or geographic mapping to aid in the underwriting process.

## **RESULTS**
The number of financing stages indicates some success for Chisel.  Other factors that indicate success include:
-	Signed up the largest P&C carrier in the US
-	Signed up with the two largest global insurance brokerages
-	Present in 27 countries
-	Signed up with “the majority of the largest players”
As there are no direct competitors, we can only source success factors from Chisel itself.   Chisel’s platform promises
-	Increasing quote capacity by 50%
-	Reduce E&O (Errors and Omissions) liability by > 10%
-	Customer Response improves to 90% from 50%.   This means an insurer actually responds to a broker’s quote request 90% of the time up from 50% of the time.
-	Cuts “manual” processing costs by 80% and is 400X faster than humans.   This translates into response time is now in minutes from days or weeks.

## **RECOMMENDATIONS**
Chisel has already endeavoured to grow the business by applying the platform to different languages.   It has added French and is now tackling Spanish.  Spanish will primarily used for the Latin American market.   The next steps here could include Japanese and/or Chinese.   In this case, the challenges go beyond the languages.   Specifically, this would involve a major time zone difference, which could pose operational and customer service challenges to Chisel’s small organization.   A likely solution would be to partner up with a local insurer.   
Another possibility to expand revenue would be to expand into reinsurance.   Reinsurance is similar to commercial P&C in that it is decision tree driven and so the business needs are the same.  Two notable differences are that there are less players (i.e. Customers), so they would have to tackle a different pricing strategy.  Also, reinsurance tends to cross borders, so integrating different laws/regulations into their platform would be advisable.   This might cross into a different fintech jurisdiction – reg tech for insurance and perhaps for other financial services outside insurance.
